# Conduit
A C# Library for uncomplicated audio streaming over Opus

> [!WARNING]
> Conduit is not yet to its 1.0 release and thus the API is **not** frozen.
> Updates will probably break your code.

### Todo:
- [ ] 100% passing test coverage
- [ ] Determine if we should break out Turnkey into its own assembly
- [ ] Find a good way to distribute opus.dll
- [ ] Publish to NuGet (possibly rename if something else is named Conduit)
- [ ] Possibly break dependency on OpusDotNet or fork to use most recent Opus library
- [ ] Switch to UDP/Multicast model with TCP management channel

### Usage:
See [Usage](USAGE.md) for library usage and [App Usage](APP_USAGE.md) for app usage.
